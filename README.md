# Unraveling the role of mitochondria dysfunction in early sepsis



I accidentally pushed sensitive data to an older repository. This is why the commit history does not reflect my work I did. Unfortunately, a `git rm` would not suffice since the data would still 'live' inside the commit history. Maybe I reacted too fast, but I will try to merge the commit history back together, or via another waty.
